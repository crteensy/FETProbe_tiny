# FETProbe_tiny

A tiny 1.3 GHz FET Probe. 

You can find [measurements here](https://electronicprojectsforfun.wordpress.com/solder-in-probes/). Additional details on the design of this probe [can be found on Hackaday](https://hackaday.io/project/184924-diy-13-ghz-fet-probe).

## Stackup

Any standard 1.6 mm thickness stackup should do the job. 1.6 mm is relevant here because it has an influence on the input capacitance.

## Production files

You can find production files under the "Summary" -> "Artifacts" section of the "Actions" tab, or in the releases section.

Manufacturing files are automatically generated for JLCPCB and included in `manufacturing.zip`. Additional documents can be found in `assembly and debugging.zip`.
