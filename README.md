# FETProbe_tiny
A tiny 1.3 GHz FET Probe

Stackup
Any standard 1.6 mm thickness stackup should do the job. 1.6 mm is relevant here because it has an influence on the input capacitance.

Gerbers
So far, gerbers were generated for JLCPCB, and they should for that manufacturer out of the box (see /gerbers/JLCPCB)

BOM and Fab pdf are in /assembly
